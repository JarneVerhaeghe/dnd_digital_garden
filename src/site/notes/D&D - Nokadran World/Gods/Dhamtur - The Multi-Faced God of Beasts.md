# Dhamtur - The Multi-Faced God of Beasts
## Background
The Beast god is seen as a god with multiple faces, nine to be exact, that inherited all powers of the previous gods that were worshipped in the lands of Drania by the different monster-folk. Dhamtur is depicted as a hairy beast-like humanoid being with multiple heads. Each head represents a leftover from the old gods. This god was resurrected by combining the remains and scraps of the old monster- and beast-like gods after the Ascensions wars. This god represents all domains and all aspects of life but each face represents a different one. This god is only worshipped by the hordes of Drania. The central face is the face of balance, harmony, creation, and time. This human-like face keeps the internal balance between the other faces and different personalities. On the left there are the four positive faces and on the right the four negative. The left four faces represent Knowledge, Life, Light, and Nature, while the right four represent War, Trickery, Death, and Tempest. Each face has bearing its own name.

In Drania, many worship the multi-faced god, but many also only worship specific heads and even despise others.
