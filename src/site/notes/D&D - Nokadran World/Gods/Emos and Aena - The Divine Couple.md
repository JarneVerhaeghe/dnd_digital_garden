# Emos and Aena - The Divine Couple
## The divine couple
The divine couple is mostly worshipped by the people of the Nokari Coasts. Emos and Aena are the official gods of the theocratic nation. These two are considered, New Gods, which were born after the Ascension wars. Both gods are associated with the concepts of life and death, as these are essential to living and therefore never separable. One cannot escape the other. Emos and Aena are two reborn Old Gods that once agreed to work together in the alliance to fight off the alliance of Unending life which supported the creation of the Ascended and the Undead. Failed in their attempt, many Old Gods who participated in the fight against the Alliance of Unending Life perished. Having lost, only two survived, heavily wounded and deprived of most of their powers. In order to keep their divine status, they formed an eternal alliance with one another, creating a bond that bundled their remaining powers. As a result, one cannot exist without the other, however, together they are able to achieve much larger divine powers as before. Furthermore, if one were to waver, the other can take over and this essentially creates a divine control structure. They are known as the Divine Couple, Emos and Aena. They represent the balance between Life and Death, and its fragility. Fated and bound together, they keep the old alliance alive to banish the unethical magic from this world.

They are mostly pictured together, as two faces back to back with a single headband across both faces representing their unbreakable bond. The strong female face represents Aena and the elegant male face represents Emos.
