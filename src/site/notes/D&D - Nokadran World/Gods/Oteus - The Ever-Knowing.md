# Oteus - The Ever-Knowing
## Background
Oteus was one of the original Neutral Ones. He never mingled in the wars and was not interested in this useless conflict. Some say he already knew the outcome. Oteus is the god of knowledge, wisdom, and nature. He was one of the oldest Old Gods, some say he was one of the first. As a result of his age, patience is his key characteristic. He is often depicted as an old man in robes with a long beard and without eyes or even eye sockets. He carries a crystal ball and a simple sceptre. His crystal ball is for looking into the future to know what is ahead, while his scepter is used to understand the present by feeling and detecting its surroundings. Without eyes, he cannot be blinded by the past and therefore only sees the truth. This god is mainly worshipped in the Aknean federation, Eldingborg,  and the Undying Empire. His symbol is a head without eyes with two hands: one holding the crystal ball, the other the scepter. 

The [[D&D - Nokadran World/Organizations/The Blind Order of Oteus\|The Blind Order of Oteus]] represents the organization of this religion.
