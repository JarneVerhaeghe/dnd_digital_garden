# Ulthos -  The God of Unending Life
## Background
Ulthos, one of the old gods of Death, was one of the first to practice and encourage Necromancy. It was in his name, that the first undead was brought back to life. Soon afterwards, Ulthos tremendously grew in power. Many gods followed him or at least supported him, while many opposed him. During the Ascension wars, he was the representative of the alliance of Unending Life. When the wars ended, he survived but lost a lot of his powers. In an effort to keep his powers he asked the remaining members of the Unending Alliance to provide him with their divine powers, essentially demoting them to a lower being and ending their god status. Many complied, as they almost had nothing left anymore. Some did not. Those that refused either left the divine plane out of their free will, were either killed or were either forcefully stripped of their powers. Eventually, only Ulthos remained as the only remaining member of the Alliance of Unending Life. He is the god of necromancy, life, and death and is mainly worshipped in the Undying Empire. He is the source of all current necromantic power. 

Ulthos is depicted using a circle with an open hand in the middle reaching out downwards. this gesture depicts the welcoming nature of Ulthos. The hand is part bone and part flesh, depicting its necromantic power.
