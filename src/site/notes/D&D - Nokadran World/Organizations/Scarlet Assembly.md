# Scarlet Assembly
## Background
The Scarlet Assembly is a semi-religious organization spanning across Nokadran following the way of the god of knowledge and patience: [[D&D - Nokadran World/Gods/Oteus - The Ever-Knowing\|Oteus - The Ever-Knowing]]. However, they do not manage the temples and religious activities of [[D&D - Nokadran World/Gods/Oteus - The Ever-Knowing\|Oteus - The Ever-Knowing]] anymore, as was their original purpose before the Ascension wars. It is one of the oldest organizations and its existence dates from before the Ascension wars. This organization has a large political influence as they are often seen as mediators and advisors. The largest branch is situated in [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/Aknean Federation/The Aknean Federation of the United races\|The Aknean Federation of the United races]] where they are an official control organ for the [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/Aknean Federation/Organizations/Great Council of The Aknean Federation\|Great Council of The Aknean Federation]] but without any actual public political power. As a result, their main office is located in [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/Aknean Federation/Towns and Cities/Akartum - Capital\|Akartum - Capital]], the capital of [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/Aknean Federation/The Aknean Federation of the United races\|The Aknean Federation of the United races]]. 
They are often considered lore keepers, as their quest for knowledge seeded the creation of many libraries. The largest of which is in [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/Eldingborg/The City-State of Eldingborg\|The City-State of Eldingborg]]. 

They are recognized by their silver-grey scarlet robes and clothes. The combination of the colours also indicates their direct function. 

The organization is led by the **High Warden**. Each branch is led by a single Warden. Other known public functions are: Chronicler (Lorekeeper for history and knowledge), Advisor (mainly only in the Aknean federation), Arcanist (Lorekeeper for anything magical), Auditor (The controlling organ), Expositor (The executive organ)
