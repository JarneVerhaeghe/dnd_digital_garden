# The Blind Order of Oteus
## Background
**Mantra:** _"The eyes are but mirrors of the past; the void is the window to the Truth."_

The Blind Order is the global organization dedicated to **[[D&D - Nokadran World/Gods/Oteus - The Ever-Knowing\|Oteus - The Ever-Knowing]]**. Operating with absolute neutrality, the Order views knowledge as the only currency of any value. They do not intervene in wars, nor do they offer moral guidance; they simply observe, record, and extract. 

The Order is divided into three distinct **"Covenants,"** each led by one member of the **Triad of the Unseen**. The Triad consists of: The Chronicler (The Past), The Witness (The Present), and The Harbinger (The Future). The three covenants are:
- The Covenant of Records
- The Masked Covenant
- The Covenant of the Inevitable

Although they are the order of knowledge, not everyone should know everything as not everyone can handle the knowledge. Therefore knowledge is kept within the order.

## Covenants
### The Covenant of Records
- **Led by:** The Chronicler
- **Theological Mandate:** "The Script of What Was."
- **Responsibility:** Archiving, Archaeology, Translation, and Historical Preservation.
- **Function:** They are the keepers of the Great Libraries. They view the past as the only absolute truth because it is finished and cannot be changed. Their agents are often found amidst ruins or following armies, not to fight, but to rescue scrolls and artifacts. They believe that a fact forgotten is a fragment of Oteus lost forever.

### The Masked Covenant
- **Led by:** The Witness
- **Theological Mandate:** "The Marrow of What Is."
- **Responsibility:** Truth-seeking, Extraction, Espionage, and Nature-monitoring.
- **Function:** This is the Extraction and Research branch. They serve as the Order’s truth-seekers and knowledge gatherers. Many of the Masked Covenant wear bandages in front of their eyes to see beyond what can be seen. If knowledge is hidden, they extract it through memory-stripping, resonance-torture, or spiritual unmasking, whatever fits at that moment. 

The Masked Covenant are often also hired by government or other organizations to act as truth-seekers and search for specific knowledge. For example there are trained monks that can blind-fight and pinpoint monsters and people to extract the truth. Clerics are specialised in mind-altering magic to get what they need. 

### The Covenant of the Inevitable
- **Led by:** The Harbinger
- **Theological Mandate:** "The Echo of What Will Be."
- **Responsibility:** Divination, Forecasting, and Temporal Observation.
- **Function:** The most detached and fatalistic branch. They don't offer prophecies to help people; they offer them to ensure the Order remains neutral as empires rise and fall. To them, the future is a fixed outcome, and they are merely the first to see it arrive.

## Important Locations
The headquarters are the Great Archives in [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/Eldingborg/Towns and Cities/Eldingborg - Capital\|Eldingborg - Capital]]. 

## Relics
- **The Crystal ball of the Future** wielded by the Harbinger
- **The Sceptre of the Present** wielded by the Witness
- **The Book of the Past** wielded by the Chronicler
## Clothes
- Simple, grey robed. Their covenant is put on their clothes:
	- The Covenant of Records has the book
	- The Masked Covenant can be recognized by their bandages
	- The Covenant of the Inevitable has the crystal ball
