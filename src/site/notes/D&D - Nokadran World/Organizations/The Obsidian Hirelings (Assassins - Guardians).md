# The Obsidian Hirelings (Assassins - Guardians)
## Background
These organizations fall under black organizations. These are neutral and only care about money. They have no morals and mostly think about themselves and their job. They are excellent in what they do. In order to become an Obsidian Hireling, you need to have certain combat skills and a track record: noteworthy kills as an assassin, or noteworthy bodyguard as Guardian. They are known to not fight to the death or put their own lives at risk and are expensive. However, as they are pretty strong, their name alone often has enough power to yield its goal. These are governed by individuals in Eldingborg, rumoured to be in the council.
