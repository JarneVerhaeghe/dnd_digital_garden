The [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/Undying Empire/Organizations/Necromantic Council of the Undying Empire\|Necromantic Council of the Undying Empire]] got overthrown by the Captors and a new regime was put in place
### 443-445 ACE: The Great Famine
The eruption of [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/Undying Empire/Other/Mount Rafell\|Mount Rafell]] sent a tectonic shiver through the continent, but its true weapon was the sky. A persistent ash-plume choked the sun for two years, devastating the grain-producing plains of [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/Undying Empire/The Undying Empire\|The Undying Empire]]. Still recovering from its own internal instabilities in 431 ACE, the Empire’s leadership failed to manage the disaster, and the "Grain Shed of Nokadran" withered.

- **The Hunger:** [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/Aknean Federation/The Aknean Federation of the United races\|The Aknean Federation of the United races]] and the [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/Nalar Kingdom/The Nalar Kingdom\|The Nalar Kingdom]], dependent on imperial exports, plummeted into mass starvation. Millions perished as bread lines turned into riots.
- **The Thalassic Awakening:** In a desperate bid for survival, the [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/Nokari Coasts/Nokari Coasts\|Nokari Coasts]] and [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/Eldingborg/The City-State of Eldingborg\|The City-State of Eldingborg]] launched massive fishing armadas into the eastern waters. They encroached upon [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/The Sovereignty of Thalassa/The Silent Reefs\|The Silent Reefs]], violating the borders of [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/The Sovereignty of Thalassa/The Sovereignty of Thalassa\|The Sovereignty of Thalassa]]
- **The Silent Cull:** For the first time in 450 years, [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/The Sovereignty of Thalassa/The Sovereignty of Thalassa\|The Sovereignty of Thalassa]] emerged from the mist as a unified nation rather than a myth. Using **Ichor-tech**, they scuttled hundreds of fishing vessels to "protect the Mother’s bounty" from the "dry-land scavengers." This event forced the mainland to finally acknowledge the Sovereignty as a public, hostile power.
### 444-449 ACE: The Grain Conflict
As millions died, the thin veneer of the **Convention of Eldingborg** cracked. The Great Famine became the catalyst for a total diplomatic collapse between [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/Aknean Federation/The Aknean Federation of the United races\|The Aknean Federation of the United races]] and [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/Nalar Kingdom/The Nalar Kingdom\|The Nalar Kingdom]].
- **Accusations of Theft:** The [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/Aknean Federation/Organizations/Great Council of The Aknean Federation\|Great Council of The Aknean Federation]] accused the Nalar nobles of stealing newly-developed Federation artifacts. These artifacts were deemed necessary by [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/Aknean Federation/The Aknean Federation of the United races\|The Aknean Federation of the United races]] to solve the Great Famine crisis.
- **The Nalar Intervention:** While Aknea starved, the Nalar Kingdom poured its divine resources into a massive magical operation to "pierce the ash." They used this magic to pierce the skies to make sunlight return, however, this magic interfered with the machines of [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/Aknean Federation/The Aknean Federation of the United races\|The Aknean Federation of the United races]]. As a result only the Nalar Kingdom was getting back their food supply. 
- **The War of Bread:** Conflict erupted. Armies clashed over the remaining fertile borders, and the Aknean Federation launched a series of "Requisition Raids" into the empire territory to secure land for their food supply.
- **The Eldingborg Peace:** In 449 ACE, the war reached a stalemate. With the beast-hordes of **Drania** beginning to push into the weakened Federation and the Empire, [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/Eldingborg/The City-State of Eldingborg\|The City-State of Eldingborg]] intervened to force a truce.

The end of the Grain Conflict fundamentally reshaped [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/Undying Empire/The Undying Empire\|The Undying Empire]], splitting the nation into three distinct agricultural and political influence zones:
1. **The Southeast (The Clockwork Fields):** Aided by **Aknean** engineers, this region turned to machinery. They use magic stone-powered harvesters and irrigation techniques to keep the soil alive which is heavily damaged by the soot rain and magma from the eruption. The necromantic magic of the mindless are the source and energy for these machines. 
2. **The Northeast (The Nalar-Groves):** Controlled by **Nalar** influence, this region uses pure magic to infuse the earth with necessary minerals. The crops here are "Ascended" growing at unnatural speeds under magical suns, though they are rumored to be tasteless.
3. **The West (The Sepulcher-Plains):** This region, which was unaffected by the eruption, refused all "modern" interventions, sticking to the traditional undead way, which there were plenty now. 
Although the empire has full autonomy, three cultural regions began to form with a divide where undead are less needed in specific regions.
