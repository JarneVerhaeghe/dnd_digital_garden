# United Corps
## Background
The United Corps is the army of The Aknean Federation. Its high seat is in Akartum, with the Speaker having the penultimate command. The main forces of The United Corps are stationed in Padurark as this is the middle of the country. In each city, there is a military and a guard division of the United Corps, eventually governed by the United Corps but often practically separately commanded. In towns and smaller communities, the United Corps directly governs these guard posts. There is a general for each province in Aknea, e.g. The Central Aknean Province is governed by General Throrri, with the capital being Padurark.
