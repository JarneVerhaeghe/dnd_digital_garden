# Everdusk Woods
## Description
The Everdusk Woods is an ancient forest, with some trees more than 1000 years old. When venturing far enough into these woods, the trees are so close to each other, it is impossible to discern day with night. The closer you go to the mountains, the more dangerous and magical these woods become.

It is said that an old kingdom ruled these forests: The Foscanian Kingdom, however, since the Convention of Eldingborg, not much is known any more about this civilization. Its old capital was Osyalion, but its knowabouts are unknown.
