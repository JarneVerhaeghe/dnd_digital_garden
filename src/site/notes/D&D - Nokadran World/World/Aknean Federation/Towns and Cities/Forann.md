# Forann
## Background
The merchant town of Forann lies strategically on the upper high road. It is a town where many merchants pass when traversing from the empire to the Nokari Coasts or Eldingborg, therefore it is a large bustling town of commerce. A human is currently mayor and it is governed by the human alliance of the Aknean Federation and lies in the North-Aknean state. Forann is built on the old remnants of a Drow town.
