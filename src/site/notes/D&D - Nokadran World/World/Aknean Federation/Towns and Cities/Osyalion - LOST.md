# Osyalion
## Background
The city of Osyalion was a prosporous and thriving city before the Ascension wars and was at one point the capital of a lost civilization, known in literature as the lost civilization of Foscana. Foscana was a kingdom ruled by elves, eladrin, and forest gnomes. The capital of the country of Foscania, was based on the birth place of the king. The king was not hereditary but chosen by the forest and the creation of a Fey Gate which is bound to a king. Osyalion was the last capital just before the fall of the kingdom, where king Lanthaeus Sarcaeyen activated the green wall powers created by mixing Nokadranian magic with fey magic. 

## Current state
because of the decree of Lanthaeus Sarcaeyen, everyone that wanted helped defend the forest and many turned into trees. In the beginning these trees were giant and looked like ents, but after a while they grew roots and become dormant. Osyalion is littered with these trees. The city is pretty intact, you can still see some beautiful elven architecture with some interesting gnomish engineering, but on many places, these trees are growing. There are buildings that have fallen apart, but many are still standing, but overgrown.
