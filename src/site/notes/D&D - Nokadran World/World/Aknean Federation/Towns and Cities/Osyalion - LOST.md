# Osyalion
## Background
The city of Osyalion was a prosporous and thriving city before the Ascension wars and was at one point the capital of a lost civilization, known in literature as the lost civilization of Foscana. Foscana was a kingdom ruled by elves, eladrin, and forest gnomes. The capital of the country of Foscania, was based on the birth place of the king. The king was not hereditary but chosen by the forest and the creation of a Fey Gate which is bound to a king. Osyalion was the last capital just before the fall of the kingdom, where king Lanthaeus Sarcaeyen activated the green wall powers created by mixing Nokadranian magic with fey magic. 

## Current state
because of the decree of Lanthaeus Sarcaeyen, everyone that wanted helped defend the forest and many turned into trees. In the beginning these trees were giant and looked like ents, but after a while they grew roots and become dormant. Osyalion is littered with these trees. The city is pretty intact, you can still see some beautiful elven architecture with some interesting gnomish engineering, but on many places, these trees are growing. There are buildings that have fallen apart, but many are still standing, but overgrown. 

# OLD CAMPAIGN INFO

Because of the decree of Lanthaeus, the fey gate here, never closed fully and also became dormant. In the depths of the old citadel in a large tree, the Fey Gate is located. Barnaby opened this gate again and is using its magic to enhance its necromantic powers. As a result, the animals here are heavily mutated and the surrouding area starts looking like the feywild. To stabilize the Fey Gate you need people with a Foscanien background. By linking a Foscanian with the Feywild you have a link between the two worlds. But normally this should be willing, if unwilling, you require many more. If the link to Foscana is small, then you also need more. Here is where Grimea plays a role, the Mushberry family have a link with Foscana. Closing the Fey Gate requires a Foscanian to freely link with the Gate and then give up their material planar spirit, meaning to die as their life force will be linked to the Gate. Currenlty Lanthaeus is still linked to the Gate. 

Barnaby managed to enter Osyalion and the Everdusk Woods using mind control on Histix -> reason why he should sacrifice himself. 
Using the Fey magic he removed a teleport barrier, locally, as such he can go back and forth a couple of times a day and also take people with him that were given by the Jade Syndicate.
