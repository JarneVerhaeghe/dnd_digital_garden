# Padurark concepts
City of around 21000 people. multiple districts.
## Description
Built on a hill with many slums around it. Many fields but located next to a marshland. A  lot of insects. Silkgarden is the crafter's and shop district. Originally this is were silk was made (which was one of the original parts of Padurark before The Ascension wars) together with Old Padurark. Cheese Water and Old Padurark are the more fancy districts. Eastway is where the workers mostly live and the military. Millbrook contains mainly mills and storages of food. Marshbrook contains many different buildings but more for poorer people. The military ward contains the keep and all important administrative buildings. The crest plaza is the main gathering area and contains mainly common folk. The main source of income is military spending and export of marsh goods. They also create many weapons and armours and export these throughout the whole country. The main roads are cobbled in the walled city as are the large roads. Around the city this is only hardened. The water supply is mad using a filtration system from the ground water and the marshes. Not many parks. Bonehill is where the cemetary is.
