Marshbrook contains many different buildings but more for poorer people. The military ward contains the keep and all important administrative buildings. The crest plaza is the main gathering area and contains mainly common folk. The main source of income is military spending and export of marsh goods. They also create many weapons and armours and export these throughout the whole country. The main roads are cobbled in the walled city as are the large roads. Around the city this is only hardened. The water supply is mad using a filtration system from the ground water and the marshes. Not many parks. Bonehill is where the cemetary is.
