## Entertainment
includes anything that is fun and isn't drinking or sex. Examples include zoos, libraries, museums, art galleries, circuses, sporting arenas, dance halls, theaters, music halls, and even blood sports.

## Guilds
are organizations dedicated to promoting one particular kind of profession. Members get benefits by joining such as being able to visit any guild house in any city that is affiliated with the home guild, discounts on profession-related items, training, and even special treatment at sponsored shops/whatever in the city itself. Examples include Fighters and Mages guilds, Craftsmen and Sailors guilds and even Cartographer and Bardic guilds.

## Inns/Taverns/Brothels (ITB)
should be obvious. Use the same population-to-building ratio as we used in determining areas of housing to figure out how many of each of these places are in a city. Brothel, is of course, optional.

## Craftsmen
are exactly that. People who take raw goods and create finished goods. Examples are almost endless with Blacksmith, Carpenter, Bowyer, Fletcher, Armorer, Weapon Smith, White (or Gold) Smith, Perfumer, Glassmaker, Cooper, Joiner, Limner, Clockmaker, Shoemaker, Leather Smith, and Wainwright.

## Government Buildings
are both the housing for the nobles of the city, and the actual buildings where the government does its business. Examples include Palace, Courts, Asylum, Currency Exchange or Bank, School, Army Barracks or Stables, Freight Warehouses, Officer housing, Embassies and Public Execution areas like a gallows or guillotine.

## Public Services
are places where the public can get help from the government, usually, but some Religions or other groups could run these. Examples include Hospitals, Guide or Messenger Services, public wells, Records or Information buildings, public housing (like a hostel), soup kitchens, or other social services like Veteran's Care.

## Security
is anything directly related to keeping the city safe. These have some cross-over with Government buildings sometimes. Examples include Watchtowers, Gatehouses, Watch Barracks, Impound or Customs Yards, Jail, Holding Cells (before transferred to the Jail) and Armories.

## Religion
encompasses actual Temples, which are large, well-staffed and sometimes house artefacts or other divine objects; Shrines which are usually much smaller, and with only a few staff (or none), and Cemetaries. 1 boneyard per 50,000 people is sufficient, I've found.

## Decoration
is anything that improves the city. Examples include statues, parks, fountains, commons, courtyards, gardens and ponds/lakes.
