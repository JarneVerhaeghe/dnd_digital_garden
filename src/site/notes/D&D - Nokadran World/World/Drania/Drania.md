# Drania
## Background
Not much is known about the dry lands of Drania. It is said to host the outcasts of the world and is seen as a barbaric country hosting many of Nokadrans monsters. The country is led by tribes, and each city is governed by a single chief. However, no-one knows what binds these tribes together and come to the geopolitical playfield as Drania.
