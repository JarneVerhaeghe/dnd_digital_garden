# The Blood Registry
## Background
   - **Purpose**: The Blood Registry is a centralized system that tracks every individual within the kingdom, including visitors. It serves as a tool for taxation, conscription, and monitoring the population.
   - **Administration**: Administered by a dedicated branch of the Noble Council, the registry ensures that everyone contributes to the kingdom, either through blood or monetary taxes.
