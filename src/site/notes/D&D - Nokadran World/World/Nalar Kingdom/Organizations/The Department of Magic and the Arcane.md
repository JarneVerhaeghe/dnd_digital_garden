# The Department of Magic and the Arcane
   - **Governance**: The Department (or the DMA) is a powerful institution that oversees the use and development of magic within the kingdom. It is governed by a council of the most skilled and respected mages, all of whom are Ascended Nobles.
   - **Regulations**: The DMA enforces strict regulations on the practice of magic, issuing licenses to those deemed worthy and punishing unauthorized use severely. They also oversee the innovation and application of magical technologies.
