# Cyngsdale
## Background
Cyngsdale is the closest town to the country's Capital, only an hour by carriage from Nalaris. Additionally, Cyngsdale was actually founded by Nalar to become a holiday accomodation, closely resembling some of Nalar's earliest memories. However, Nalar only visited in the early years of its origin after The Ascension Wars. Afterwards, he never returned and it was renamed to the current name: Cyngsdale.
