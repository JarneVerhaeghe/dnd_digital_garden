# Logris
## Background/Description
Logris is the city North of Logrinnstadt on side of the Logr lake. It is a lake harbour town where a lot of trade happens. The city is layered, where the harbour is of lowest status and the highest parts of a higher status. A vampiric vibe lingers. The buildings are white spires with evergreen wood from the tundras to the north. The city hall is at the top of the city. Every tier of the city has their own tier of the population.
