# The Short History of Nokadran
## Prologue

**Death**. Many living things do not want to die but all come across its path. Some accept it, others try to avoid it. It was a human, Nalar the first, that was the first to suspend death, called ascension. He became known as the primal noble. Many followed him into the path of immortality, sharing his knowledge for those that inquired, regardless of their race. However, it was also met with great opposition as others were of the opinion that death should not be cheated.

## The Ascension wars

Eventually, society divided and the war of Ascension came upon all, mortals and dieties alike. In these times where death was everywhere, a second form of immortality was secretly discovered, a more macabre form stemming from death itself. The first of these kinds were mindless, only following their master, but after time progressed these started to show signs of intelligence, autonomy and even preserved their mind and became stronger than when they lived. This art of necromancy was performed by both the living to reduce losses as by the immortals. Eventually, many of these undead rose but outlived their masters. The mindless and those living but black-hearted attacked indiscriminately and they were with many, starting The Purge of the Ascension wars. 

## The Purge

First, millions died. Giving all a new common enemy, all living races and ascended founded the Alliance of Nokadran combatting the new enemy. After many battles, the combined forces succeeded in reducing The Mindless Hordes, but mindful undead remained, without a home or master they were doomed to roam the lands of Nokadran. With the common enemy gone, the differences in ideals and races started to crumble the alliance once again. 

## The Convention of Eldingborg

After the last battle against the mindless on the Nokari peninsula, all great leaders of each race and Ascended gathered in the island city of Eldingborg, discussing the future of Nokadran. There, both the living and the ascended decided to found a new country for the undead, dedicating their most trustworthy and gifted necromancers to guide all roaming mindful undead and prevent a second Purge from happening. As the different interpretations of life were too severe, those that worship unending life and Ascended were gifted the Northern lands, now known as the Nalar kingdom. Those worshipping the gifts of life stayed in the South in the lands of Aknea and Nokari, forming the Aknean Federation of the United Races and the Mercantile nation of the Nokari Coasts. This Convention of Eldingborg signed the start of the new era of peace.
