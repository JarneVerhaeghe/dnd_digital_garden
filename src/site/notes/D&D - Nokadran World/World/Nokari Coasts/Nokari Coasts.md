# Nokari Coasts
![Nokari_coasts_map.jpg](/img/user/Figures/Nokari_coasts_map.jpg)
## Background
The Nokari coasts split 109 years after the convention of Eldenborg from the Aknean federation due to different religious and economical beliefs. The people of the Nokari coasts can be considered as extremely religious people where freedom of religion is non-existent. As they believe that this freedom was the true reason for the beginning of the Ascension wars. Religion and magic are governed and licensed by the theocratic state, however, economically they are fully libertarian resulting in a very mercantile but conservative nation, taking advantage of its geographical location. The country is led by a theocratic leader called the Pontifex.

## Overview
### Geography and Environment
- **Landscape:** A low-lying maritime region. The "Silt-Lands" consist of vast, saline-saturated meadows, ancient coastal forests, and treacherous marshlands. Much of the nation sits only 2–5 meters above sea level, protected by elaborate dike systems.
- **Climate:** Perpetual mist and salt-spray. The weather is cool, windy, and damp. Winters are surprisingly temperate due to warm ocean currents, while summers remain mild and overcast.
- **Natural Resources:** The saline soil makes traditional farming difficult, leading to a focus on **Herb-craft** (salt-resistant medicinal plants) and **Fine Clay** harvesting. The region is the primary producer of **Nokari-Parchment** (high-quality, magic-conductive paper) and other forms of high-quality paper.

### History
- **Origin Story**: The Nokari coasts are formed after The Religious Revolution of Nokari in 108-109 ACE where the church split from the federation and created their own country in the east far away from the undead. 
- **Legends and Myths**: Many of the myths and legends are about the Holy Couple, other older legends mainly entail sea stories

### Society and Culture
- **Races and Ethnicities**: The Nokari Coasts are aggressively "traditionalist." The population prizes racial lineage, viewing "mixed" heritages (such as Half-Elves or Half-Orcs) as a dilution of the Holy Couple's design.
- **Social Structure**: Status is not derived from noble titles, but from The Ledger and the Altar. One’s worth is measured by their guild standing and their perceived piety. While "new money" is possible, the elite families usually control both a merchant seat and a high-ranking priesthood.
- **Customs and Traditions**: Festivals are there to honor the Holy Couple and there are various holidays that celebrate key moments in the legends of the Holy Couple. 
### Government and Politics
- **Government Structure**: The country is ruled by the Pontifex with the council of three. The council of three consists of the Pontifex of the [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/Nokari Coasts/Organizations/Holy Church of Aena and Emos\|Holy Church of Aena and Emos]], The Grand Factor of [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/Nokari Coasts/Organizations/The Radiant Merchant Guild\|The Radiant Merchant Guild]], and The High Justiciar of [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/Nokari Coasts/Organizations/The Tribunal of Balance\|The Tribunal of Balance]]. The High Justiciar is the tie-breaker but the Pontifex has veto-rights.
- **Laws and Justice**: Economic laws are libertarian while other laws are of a theological nature dictated by the Pontifex and enforced by the [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/Nokari Coasts/Organizations/The Tribunal of Balance\|The Tribunal of Balance]]. Justice is always carried out; you cannot be pure without justice.
- **Political Climate**: Houses and lineage or of no importance here creating frustrations between the Guild and the Church. The ban on other religion makes this even worse.
- **The Divine Corps:** Is the army led by the [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/Nokari Coasts/Organizations/Holy Church of Aena and Emos\|Holy Church of Aena and Emos]] and has a stronger divine navy since the grain conflict.

### Economy
- **The Radiant Monopoly:** [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/Nokari Coasts/Organizations/The Radiant Merchant Guild\|The Radiant Merchant Guild]] standardizes all weights, measures, and exchange rates.
- **Banking:** The Coasts are the "Bankers of Nokadran." Because [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/Nokari Coasts/Organizations/The Tribunal of Balance\|The Tribunal of Balance]] treats a defaulted loan as a **mortal sin**, Nokari contracts are the most trusted in the world.
- **Primary Industries:**
    - **The Paper Trade:** Most magical scrolls in the world are written on Nokari paper.
    - **Apothecary:** Advanced medicines derived from marsh-herbs, sought throughout Nokadran and only producable in the Coasts.
    - **Textiles:** Waterproof and heat-resistant "Silk" and enchanted liturgical vestments.
    - **Pottery and glassware**: The high-quality clay and sand allows for strong and durable glass and pottery
    - **Salt**: Given its coastal region, this country is the main exporter of salt worldwide
- **Currency**: The official currency is the similar to the other countries, Gold pieces
### Religion and Beliefs

- **Deities**: Only the Holy Couple is allowed
- **Religious Practices**: There are weekly sermons for the Holy Couple where attendance is highly encouraged to show dedication. Only work or sickness is allowed to be an excuse to not come. 
- **Philosophies**: Life is holy and must not be altered
### Magic and Technology
- **Magic System**: All magic is allowed except for necromancy. The church oversees the usage of magic and limitations are in place for public magic in name of security. 
- **Technological Level**: Simple, the logistical chain is very developed with advanced vehicles now even magical stones from the federation to speed up trade
- **Inventions**: Scrolls, Art, and magical clothing
### Conflicts and Challenges
- **Internal Conflicts**: There are tensions between the merchants and the church where one often says that the other hampers their workings. Not everyone is also fond of the highly religious nature of the country.
- **External Threats**: The Sovereignty of Thalassa is the biggest threat due to piracy
### Notable Locations
- **Capital City**: [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/Nokari Coasts/Towns and Cities/Nokamarr - Capital\|Nokamarr - Capital]]
