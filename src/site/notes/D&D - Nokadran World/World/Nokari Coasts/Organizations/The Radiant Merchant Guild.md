# The Radiant Merchant Guild
The radiant merchant guild is the official merchant organization responsible for all trade and economy in the [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/Nokari Coasts/Nokari Coasts\|Nokari Coasts]] and outside. They govern the Elding bay, govern trade, and dictate world prices. You are free to trade from wherever you are, but the guild ensures correct pricing, standards, and the word of the Holy Couple. The guild is led by The Grand Factor or the guild leader.

## Dutch
- Radiant Merchant Guild = "De Stralende Handelsgilde"
