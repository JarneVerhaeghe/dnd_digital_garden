# The Tribunal of Balance
The **Tribunal of the Radiant Balance** serves as the ultimate corrective force in [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/Nokari Coasts/Nokari Coasts\|Nokari Coasts]], acting as the bridge between the **divine mandates** of the Pontifex and the **commercial ambitions** of the Grand Factor. In this land, a lie is not just a breach of contract—it is a stain on the soul.
### ## The Philosophy: "Fairness Through Light"
The Tribunal operates on the belief that the universe exists in a state of balance like Emos and Aena, two sides of a coint. They believe that gold must be pure, scales must be honest, and promises must be eternal. Their motto is often: _“As the Couple sees all, the Scale weighs all.”_

### ### The High Justiciar’s Role
The High Justiciar is the **Chief Arbiter**. While the Pontifex prays for the people and the Grand Factor enriches them, the High Justiciar ensures they remain **orderly**. They hold the "Veto of the Center," able to strike down any mercantile deal that is unholy, or any religious decree that would bankrupt the state.

### ## Organization & Hierarchy
- **The Arbiters (The Judges):** The elite tier of the Tribunal. They travel in groups of three to settle major disputes between Merchant Houses or Church Parishes. 
- **The Verifiers (The Investigators):** The "boots on the ground." Part forensic accountant, part inquisitor. They have the legal right to enter any warehouse, counting-house, or cathedral to "verify the weights."
- **The Silenced Clerks:** A specialized sect of monks trained by the [[D&D - Nokadran World/Organizations/Scarlet Assembly\|Scarlet Assembly]] who have taken a vow of silence to ensure they never leak the sensitive trade secrets or "confessional sins" they record during Tribunal hearings.

### ## The Headquarters: The Hall of Aequitas
Located exactly halfway between the Grand Cathedral and the Guild’s Great Exchange, the Hall of Aequitas is a marvel of architecture in Nokamarr.

- **The Noon-Day Court:** The main trial chamber has a retractable ceiling. At high noon, the sun shines directly onto the "Great Balance," a massive set of scales made of white marble and gold.
- **The Vault of Covenants:** Deep beneath the hall lies the storage for every "High Contract" ever signed. These documents are written in **Lumina Ink**, which glows brightly if the parties involved are acting in good faith, and fades to black if a party intends to betray the deal.

### ## Symbols & Tools of Office

|**Object**|**Name**|**Purpose**|
|---|---|---|
|**The Primary Scale**|_The Weight of Truth_|A portable, enchanted set of scales that can detect the weight of a person’s "word."|
|**The Justiciar’s Robes**|_The Prism Raiment_|Shimmering white robes that refract light into rainbows, symbolizing that the Truth has many facets but one source.|
|**The Gavel**|_The Sun-Strike_|A hammer made of solid quartz that emits a sharp "crack" of thunder when a verdict is reached.|

### ## Cultural Impact: "The Weighting"
In this country, citizens don't just go to court; they go to **"The Weighting."** If a merchant is accused of hoarding or a priest is accused of embezzling, they are placed on the literal scales of the Tribunal. If the scales tip too far toward "Shadow" (guilt), the punishment is often **Total Forfeiture**: their wealth is seized by [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/Nokari Coasts/Organizations/The Radiant Merchant Guild\|The Radiant Merchant Guild]] and their soul is "excommunicated" by the Pontifex of [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/Nokari Coasts/Organizations/Holy Church of Aena and Emos\|Holy Church of Aena and Emos]], leaving them a non-person in the eyes of the law.
