# City Breakdown
## The Western Enclave (The Inner City)

This section of the city is protected by a secondary inner wall, separating the high-status wards from the industrial and peripheral zones.
### Cistern Ward
Located in the heart of the walled western section, this is the city's primary residential hub for established citizens
- **The Look:** Densely packed brick housing that extends both above and below ground to maximize space in the low-lying maritime environment.
- **The Function:** It manages the city's fresh water through a series of massive underground reservoirs (the Cisterns) that are blessed by the **Holy Church of Aena and Emos**.
- **The Vibe:** Quiet and orderly; "Echo-Pillars" (think Islamic Minarets) throughout the ward broadcast rhythmic hymns to ensure the residents remain in a state of constant, productive prayer.

### Terrace Ward & Lower Terrace
These districts represent the social ladder of Emosaer, positioned near the seat of local power.
- **Terrace Ward:** The "Upper" terrace sits on the highest artificial ground, housing the elite **Merchant-Factors** and high-ranking members of the **Circle of Cardinals**.
- **Lower Terrace:** A bustling district for the middle class, clerks of **The Radiant Merchant Guild**, and legal scribes of **The Tribunal of Balance**.
- **The Fantasy:** Perpetual "Sun-Wards" are maintained here to cut through the perpetual salt-mist, keeping the orange brick buildings gleaming with golden light.

### The Cliff
The northernmost point of the inner city, acting as a natural (or magically reinforced) lookout.
- **The Look:** A sheer drop-off overlooking the northern marshes and the sprawling eastern districts.
- **The Function:** It serves as a primary signal station; massive brass mirrors reflect the "Holy Light" to guide ships entering the bay during heavy mists.

## The Central Hub
### The Market Place & The Smoke Quay
The economic engine where the city meets the sea.
- **The Smoke Quay:** The main harbor where the "Censer Docks" burn fog-clearing incense to create clear "tunnels of air" for incoming merchant fleets.
- **The Market Place:** A frantic wholesale district where the **Radiant Merchant Guild** standardizes all trade with the big trade hall being the centerpiece.
- **The Reality:** All goods passing from the Quay to the Marketplace are weighed on the **Great Scales of Emos**, ensuring the theocratic state receives its precise tithe.
## The Eastern Sprawl
The eastern half of the city is more exposed and represents the vast industrial and working-class power of the harbor.
### Radiant Gate
The massive checkpoint and fortress-gate that divides the inner western enclave from the eastern sprawl.
- **The Function:** Manned by the **Divine Corps**, this gate is where papers, debt, and religion are checked.

### The Sea Wall
In Emosaer, the Sea Wall is not just a fortification but a massive, sprawling district that houses the bulk of the city's labor force.
- **The Look:** A labyrinth of brick and wood buildings built directly into or alongside the massive sea-defenses that protect the nation from the **Sovereignty of Thalassa** and the rising tides together with dikes.
- **The Industry:** This district houses the massive glass-blowing furnaces and the "Loom-Cathedrals" where waterproof silk is woven to the sound of tuning forks.

### Salt Gallow
The northern fringe of the eastern sprawl, existing on the edge of the silt-lands.
- **The Look:** A damp, foggy slum of stilt-houses and sod-huts.
- **The Population:** Home to mostly outcasts and those that do not really follow the creed or have large debts

## The Outskirts
### Silk Row & Salt Watch
Located on the western periphery, these districts handle the "dirty work" of the city's defense and textiles.
- **Silk Row:** An industrial strip dedicated to the cultivation of "Silk worms" and the initial processing of raw marsh-fibers into **Nokari-Parchment**.
- **Salt Watch:** The southwestern garrison where the **Divine Corps** monitors the coastline for undead threats and maritime incursions.
