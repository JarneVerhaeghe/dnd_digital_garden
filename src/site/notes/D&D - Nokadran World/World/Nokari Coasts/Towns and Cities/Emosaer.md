# Emosaer
## Description
Emosaer functions as large industrial and mercantile city of [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/Nokari Coasts/Nokari Coasts\|Nokari Coasts]], a city defined by its central location on the mainland and its critical role in the trade of waterproof vestments, fine pottery, and Nokari vestments. As a hub for [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/Nokari Coasts/Organizations/The Radiant Merchant Guild\|The Radiant Merchant Guild]], the city's architecture reflects its environment, with buildings primarily constructed from local brick and clay supported by salt-resistant timber to survive the surrounding salt marshes and the coastal wind. The atmosphere is a thick sensory blend of brine from the sea and marshes, mixed with the heavy scent of holy incense, the silver-laced iconography of the Holy Couple found throughout the city center, and the scheduled prayers. While the [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/Nokari Coasts/Organizations/Holy Church of Aena and Emos\|Holy Church of Aena and Emos]] maintains a strong presence due to the city’s proximity to the capital, the theocratic laws are notably less strict here than in other Nokari cities to accommodate the vital flow of international commerce. The city is divided into specialized districts: the inner Cistern and Terrace Wards house the elite and administrative functions like **the Justiciary** and the **Basilica of the Holy Couple**, while the Market Place and Smoke Quay serve as the epicenter of (sea) trade. To the east, the large Sea Wall protects the sprawl and houses the "Loom-Cathedrals" where the city’s famous textiles are woven. The outskirts are a patchwork of medicinal herb patches and silk farming, though the terrain is treacherous; travellers who wander offroad risk falling into hidden swamp pits or the vast "Silt-Lands" that characterize the region.

# City Breakdown
## The Western Enclave (The Inner City)

This section of the city is protected by a secondary inner wall, separating the high-status wards from the industrial and peripheral zones.
### Cistern Ward
Located in the heart of the walled western section, this is the city's primary residential hub for established citizens
- **The Look:** Densely packed brick housing that extends both above and below ground to maximize space in the low-lying maritime environment.
- **The Function:** It manages the city's fresh water through a series of massive underground reservoirs (the Cisterns) that are blessed by the **Holy Church of Aena and Emos**.
- **The Vibe:** Quiet and orderly; "Echo-Pillars" (think Islamic Minarets) throughout the ward broadcast rhythmic hymns to ensure the residents remain in a state of constant, productive prayer.

### Terrace Ward & Lower Terrace
These districts represent the social ladder of Emosaer, positioned near the seat of local power.
- **Terrace Ward:** The "Upper" terrace sits on the highest artificial ground, housing the elite **Merchants** and high-ranking members of the **Circle of Cardinals**.
- **Lower Terrace:** A bustling district for the middle class, clerks of **The Radiant Merchant Guild**, and legal scribes of **The Tribunal of Balance**.
- **The Fantasy:** Perpetual "Sun-Wards" are maintained here to cut through the perpetual salt-mist, keeping the orange brick buildings gleaming with golden light.

### The Cliff
The northernmost point of the inner city, acting as a natural (or magically reinforced) lookout.
- **The Look:** A sheer drop-off overlooking the northern marshes and the sprawling eastern districts.
- **The Function:** It serves as a primary signal station; massive brass mirrors reflect the "Holy Light" to guide ships entering the bay during heavy mists.

## The Central Hub
### The Market Place & The Smoke Quay
The economic engine where the city meets the sea.
- **The Smoke Quay:** The main harbor where the "Censer Docks" burn fog-clearing incense to create clear "tunnels of air" for incoming merchant fleets.
- **The Market Place:** A frantic wholesale district where the **Radiant Merchant Guild** standardizes all trade with the big trade hall being the centerpiece.
- **The Reality:** All goods passing from the Quay to the Marketplace are weighed on the **Great Scales of Emos**, ensuring the theocratic state receives its precise tithe.
## The Eastern Sprawl
The eastern half of the city is more exposed and represents the vast industrial and working-class power of the harbor.
### Radiant Gate
The massive checkpoint and fortress-gate that divides the inner western enclave from the eastern sprawl.
- **The Function:** Manned by the **Divine Corps**, this gate is where papers, debt, and religion are checked.

### The Sea Wall
In Emosaer, the Sea Wall is not just a fortification but a massive, sprawling district that houses the bulk of the city's labor force.
- **The Look:** A labyrinth of brick and wood buildings built directly into or alongside the massive sea-defenses that protect the nation from the **Sovereignty of Thalassa** and the rising tides together with dikes.
- **The Industry:** This district houses the massive glass-blowing furnaces and the "Loom-Cathedrals" where waterproof silk is woven to the sound of tuning forks.

### Salt Gallow
The northern fringe of the eastern sprawl, existing on the edge of the silt-lands.
- **The Look:** A damp, foggy slum of stilt-houses and sod-huts.
- **The Population:** Home to mostly outcasts and those that do not really follow the creed or have large debts

## The Outskirts
### Silk Row & Salt Watch
Located on the western periphery, these districts handle the "dirty work" of the city's defense and textiles.
- **Silk Row:** An industrial strip dedicated to the cultivation of "Silk worms" and the initial processing of raw marsh-fibers into **Nokari vestments**.
- **Salt Watch:** The southwestern garrison where the **Divine Corps** monitors the coastline for undead threats and maritime incursions.
