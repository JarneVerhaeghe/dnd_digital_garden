# Grasburg
## Background
### Origin Story of Grasburg
Grasburg is a northern settlement located on the Nokari Coasts, primarily inhabited by Orcs, Half-orcs, Goblins, and Ogres. While these are typically considered monster-races, the city was founded by a group of highly intelligent, religious nomads who originally hailed from Drania. Feeling out of place in their homeland, they sought a new life under the guidance of a renowned prophet and paladin. 

The city’s founder, Red’Imere Aanchalson, was a half-orc Paladin of the Holy Couple: Emos and Aena. Having grown up within the aggressive Graskul tribe on the Nokari Coasts, Red’Imere eventually traveled the world, even venturing deep into the southwestern wastes of Drania. There, he convinced groups of intelligent High Orcs and other monster-races to follow him. His goal was to prove that monster-races could be civilized and live within the light of his faith.

Red’Imere returned to the mainland of Nokadran and the Nokari Coasts and began pacifying various local tribes. One of his biggest success is the city of Grasburg. Through his efforts, he transformed the former Graskul orc war-camp into a proper, permanent settlement. With the official permission of the Holy Pontifex, Grasburg was even established as a sanctioned refuge for monster-races, provided they followed the religious laws of the Church.

### The City Layout & Atmosphere
Grasburg is a marvel of adaptive wooden and basalt architecture, designed to accommodate citizens of all sizes.
- **The Plaza of the Prophet:** At the city’s heart stands a massive bronze statue of Red’Imere, his hand outstretched toward the south in a gesture of welcome and his shield depicting the Holy Couple. Behind him sits the **Council Hall**, where the chiefs council debate city law.
- **The Great Scale Districts:** You will find "Ogre-high" doorways beside "Goblin-low" tunnels. The city is a patchwork of Dranian aesthetics and sturdy Northern Nokari stone.
- **The Sanctum of the Twins:** A massive cathedral dedicated to Emos and Aena. It serves as both a place of worship and the headquarters for the local church that oversees the city.

### The Social Contract: "The Creed"
Life in Grasburg is defined by the **Aenari-Emosian Creed**. The Church permits the settlement’s existence on three conditions:
1. **The Vow of Productivity:** Every citizen must contribute to the city’s export (fishing, mining, or smithing) to remain self-sufficient.
2. **The Light of Law:** Violent tribal traditions are forbidden; justice is handled by the Church-sanctioned courts.
3. **The Open Gate:** Any "intelligent being" who seeks refuge and swears the oath may enter, regardless of their past.
Anyone who does not abide by these laws are either punished by the church or deemed a fit end by the chiefs council.
