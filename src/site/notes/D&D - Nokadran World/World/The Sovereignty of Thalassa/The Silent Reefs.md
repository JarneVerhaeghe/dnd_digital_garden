# The Silent Reefs
A collection of islands, east of the Elding bay. Here rests [[D&D - Nokadran World/Gods/Thalassa - The Chained Goddess of the Sea\|Thalassa - The Chained Goddess of the Sea]] and is banished here. A mysterious aura lingers and is the home of [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/The Sovereignty of Thalassa/The Sovereignty of Thalassa\|The Sovereignty of Thalassa]].
