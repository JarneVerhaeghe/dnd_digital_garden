# The Sovereignty of Thalassa
![sovereignty_map.jpg](/img/user/Figures/sovereignty_map.jpg)
## Background
The sovereignty is located in [[D&D - Nokadran World/World/The Sovereignty of Thalassa/The Silent Reefs\|The Silent Reefs]] and are followers of [[D&D - Nokadran World/Gods/Thalassa - The Chained Goddess of the Sea\|Thalassa - The Chained Goddess of the Sea]].  They are a Stratocracy (Military Rule) balanced by a Guild-based Bureaucracy, called the High Registry. 

The history of the Sovereignty is divided into three distinct eras that explain how a group of outcasts became a structured country.

In the immediate aftermath of the **Convention of Eldingborg**, the Silent Reefs were merely a graveyard. Refugees who were too "monstrous" for Nokadran or too "rebellious" for the Undying Empire fled to the mists. They lived in the rusted hulls of **Ascension-era warships**, surviving on salvage and the "miracle" of the blue, glowing water (Thalassa's Ichor). Politics were non-existent; it was the rule of the strongest pirate lords.

As the population grew, "The Great Rust" set in. The ship-homes were failing. A group of former **Alliance engineers** and **Sinker-Captains** realized that to survive, they needed to harness the environment. They established the **Three Pillars**: Admiralty, Reef-Wardens, and Silence-Keepers to transition from a pirate fleet into a permanent settlement. They began growing "Blue-Bone" coral over the ancient God-Chains, turning the goddess's prison into the foundation of their cities and uses these to build their homes in conjunction with the wood present to replace stone. 

The Sovereignty today is a **Stratocratic Bureaucracy**. They have moved past the raw fanatical worship of Thalassa. While her legend remains their spiritual heart, she is now viewed as the "Silent Engine" of their nation. 

The capital is Marithal (Where the High Registry lies)

# Overview
## The Political Structure: The High Registry

The Sovereignty is governed by **The High Registry**, a central administration that views the country as a single, complex machine.

### **The Three Pillars**

Power is balanced between three specialized branches, ensuring that no single pirate lord or priest can seize total control.

| **Branch**              | **Leadership**       | **Core Function**                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **The Admiralty**       | The High Admiral     | **Defense & Expansion.** Commands the Misted Fleet. They manage the "Privateer Contracts" that allow citizens to raid the **Nokari Coasts** as a form of state-sanctioned tax collection. |
| **The Reef-Wardens**    | The Master Architect | **Urbanization & Salvage.** They govern the "Holds" (islands). Their primary job is the harvesting of **Ascension-era** artifacts and the growth of coral infrastructure.                 |
| **The Silence-Keepers** | The Prime Technician | **Security & Technology.** They maintain the "Mysterious Aura." They treat the goddess's presence as a natural resource, managing the extraction of Ichor for their boats and islands     |

## National Ideology: What They Stand For

The Sovereignty is not a lawless "rogue country" because they lack rules; they are rogue because they **reject the mainland's reality.**

- **The Ametric Philosophy:** They believe the world's fixation on the "Life vs. Death" binary (Emos/Aena vs. Ulthos) is a trap. To be "Ametric" is to be unmeasured, to exist without the interference of gods who would rather bind or ascend you than let you be free.
- **Mastery of the Deep:** They stand for the belief that the ocean is the final frontier. While the mainland nations squabble over land borders, the Sovereignty looks downward, expanding their territory into the trenches.
- **The "Cleanse" Heritage:** They have preserved the spirit of Thalassa’s "Great Cleansing" by reinterpreting it as **Antiseptic Isolation**. They don't want to drown the world anymore; they simply want to remain the only "clean" society, free from the necromancy and divine meddling that they believe still rot the mainland.

## Social Order: The "Hush" and the "Hammer"

Society is ordered by **Utility**. Every citizen is "Registered" and must contribute to the Pillar they serve.

1. **The Registry Mark:** Upon earning citizenship (usually after five years of service), a person receives a bioluminescent tattoo behind the ear. This mark is the only "passport" recognized in the islands.
2. **The Code of Silence:** In the Sovereignty, privacy is the highest virtue. They have a cultural disdain for the "loud" gods like **Neltuna**. Their cities are unnaturally quiet; to speak loudly in public is considered a sign of low intelligence or mainland "pollution."
3. **Mindful Integration:** They are the only nation where **Mindful Undead** are integrated into the labor force as equals. Because Thalassa’s aura suppresses the necrotic "hunger" felt by many undead, they become calm, efficient citizens often serving in the Abyssal salvage crews.
    
## Current Standing: The "Grey Peace"

The Sovereignty currently exists in a state of **Active Neutrality**. They are too dangerous to attack directly due to the shifting reefs and the Aura, but they are too valuable to destroy because they are the primary source of refurbished **Ascension-era technology** for the **Nokari** black markets.

**Their Goal:** To eventually grow the **Silent Reefs** until they encompass the entire **Elding Bay**, effectively forcing the **Convention of Eldingborg** to be rewritten with the Sovereignty as a primary world power.

## The Architecture: "The Blue-Bone Style"

- **The Stone:** Builders use matured, calcified blue coral. It is as hard as marble but possesses a faint, natural bioluminescence. At night, the cities glow with a soft, ghostly sapphire light.
- **The Integration:** Buildings aren't just placed on islands; they are carved into the cliffs and integrated with the reefs. Grand staircases lead directly into the water, and many homes have "tide-basements" that flood and drain with the moon.
- **The Greenery:** The islands are covered in **Salt-Oaks** and **Siren-Willows**, trees with silver-grey bark and deep blue leaves that thrive on the magical mist. These forests are dense and provide the "living canopy" that helps hide the islands from aerial scrying.
