# Iron-Wake

**Pillar Focus:** The Admiralty **Location:** The western edge of the reefs, facing the **Nokari Coasts** and **Elding Bay**.

**Iron-Wake** is the Sovereignty’s shield and sword. It is constructed from the massive, interlocking hulls of the original **Ascension-era** warships that were scuttled here 450 years ago. The rusted iron has been reinforced with living coral, creating a hybrid of metal and stone.

Located on a jagged, wind-swept island, **Iron-Wake** is a city of high walls and deep harbors. It looks like a fortified Mediterranean citadel, but the stone is a dark, obsidian-like coral.

- **The Bastion Gates:** Two colossal statues of faceless warriors stand at the harbor entrance, their feet submerged in the surf. They are hollowed out and hold the city’s heavy defensive ballistae.
    
- **The Admiralty Plaza:** A wide, paved square where the Misted Fleet’s officers gather. The "paving stones" are actually the nameplates of every ship the Sovereignty has sunk in the last four centuries.
    
- **The Sea-Cypress Groves:** The city is surrounded by tall, thin trees that act as windbreaks and camouflage for the barracks hidden in the woods.
