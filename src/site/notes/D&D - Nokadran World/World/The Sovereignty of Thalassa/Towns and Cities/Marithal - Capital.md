# Marithal - Capital
**Pillar Focus:** The High Registry & The Silence-Keepers **Location:** The exact center of the Silent Reefs, directly above the "Heart-Anchor" of Thalassa.

**Marithal** is built around a massive, perfectly circular lagoon. It resembles a classical metropolis like ancient Athens or Rome, but built entirely of shimmering blue-white coral.

- **The Great Colonnade:** A miles-long walkway of massive coral pillars that rings the inner lagoon. This is where the **High Registry** conducts the "Silent Census."
    
- **The Dome of the Muted:** A massive, open-air temple-palace where the Grand Registrar resides. It has no roof, allowing the "Silent Mist" of Thalassa to pour into the halls like dry ice.
    
- **The Gardens of Athesis:** Lush terrace gardens filled with glowing flora and white-leafed trees that overlook the sea. It is the center of philosophy and "Ametric" thought.
