# Oraxes (The Maw-Hold)
**Pillar Focus:** The Reef-Wardens (Salvage & Industry) **Location:** Suspended over the **Abyssal Trench**, a two-mile-deep chasm within the reef.

Built on the steep cliffs of a volcanic caldera, **Oraxes** is a "Vertical City." It consists of hundreds of white coral villas and workshops that descend the cliffside in elegant tiers toward the water’s edge.

- **The Water-Stair:** A single, grand staircase of 1,000 steps that runs from the highest mountain peak down into the Abyssal Trench.
    
- **The Artisan Terraces:** Where the "Master Architects" and "Technicians" live. Their villas are draped in flowering sea-vines that smell of salt and jasmine.
    
- **The Drowned Aqueducts:** Instead of carrying water _to_ the city, these channels move pressurized "Ichor" from the deep-sea pumps up to the villas to provide light and heat.
