# Vellum
**Pillar Focus:** Civil Administration & External Trade **Location:** The easternmost point of the reefs, where the "Aura" is thinnest.

**Vellum** is the Sovereignty’s only "open" city and its primary gateway for refugees. It is a beautiful, sprawling archipelago of floating platforms and shallow-water coral gardens. It serves as the hub for the **Grey Market** trade with the **Nokari Coasts**.

The most "traditional" looking of the four, **Vellum** is a sprawling island town of canals and bridges, reminiscent of Venice but surrounded by a dense, tropical jungle.

- **The Canopy Markets:** Much of the city is built under the shade of massive **Ichor-Oaks**, with bridges connecting tree-villas to coral-stone plazas.
    
- **The Grey Exchange:** A wide, marble-like dock where the "Unproven" and foreign merchants meet. It is lined with statues of Thalassa in her original form—a serene mermaid queen before she turned rogue.
    
- **The Shallows Canal:** A beautiful waterway that cuts through the center of the island, lined with taverns and inns for refugees.
