# The Undying Empire
## Background
The most notorious country in the whole of Nokadran is the land of the undead. Originally given as a refuge after the Convention of Eldingborg for the undead and kept together by the dark magic of necromancy. What started as a vassal state to both the Nalar Kingdom and the Aknean Federation, sprouted into an entirely new prosperous country of agriculture, labour and magic and became known as the Grain Storage of Nokadran. The undead are used as labour, depending on their mental level in agriculture, crafts and military. The empire follows the laws dedicated by the Undying Emperor, the strongest Necromancer originally chosen by both the Nalar kingdom and Aknean Federation to rule the new country in the Convention of Eldingborg. Even though the country is dedicated to the undead, the living are very common here. Each has its own reason as it is regarded as the land of the dreams, where you can achieve what you want in life if you can handle presence of the undead of course. The current emperor is [[DnD happy adventures/Personages/BIG NPCS/Auron Denholm\|Auron Denholm]].
