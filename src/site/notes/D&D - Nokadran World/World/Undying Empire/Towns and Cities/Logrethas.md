# Logrethas
## Background
A ruined city in the Undying Empire. It is the old capital of the Kingdom that resided in where the empire now is located in the undying empire. Originally an Elven city where human settlers came and made new buildings. The undying wars and the volcano ruined the city and made people evacuate the region. The first necromantic council was held here, during the undying wars. In this location the religion of Ulthos was founded. 

De stad ligt tussen mount rafel en Velkagras
