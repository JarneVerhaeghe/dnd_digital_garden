## Flavor Text
Logrinnstadt  is een stad midden op een groot meer, geconnecteerd met een grote brug, langs 1 kant maar. Het meer is ook volgebouwd. Het water is groenblauw. Het zand is wit met groene stenen, deze groene stenen geven de groene schijn van het water. Aan de overkant van het meer is een oud dennenwoud. Begin van de brug is ook volgebouwd. Denk meer aan Venetie. Veel bruggen, water, en boten. De gebouwen zijn gemaakt van witte bakstenen met groene accenten. Zeer harde fan van bogen overal, heeft een elfen sfeer. Was origineel ook een stad van elfen. Hoge torens etc, elegante bouwwerken. Maar door de recente ontwikkelingen krijg je ook meer simpele bouwwerken met zwarte stenen, bakstenen etc. De kern is elegant, de rand begint hout en baksteen te worden.


## The council
A large building with many white spikes.  
**Luminethos Spire**: This name combines "lumen," meaning light, with "ethos," denoting the character and spirit of a place. It reflects the juxtaposition of light and darkness within the tower, where the bright elvish architecture is infused with the shadowy arts of necromancy.

In the heart of Logrinnstadt rises the grand edifice known as the Luminethos Spire, or the Spire, a marvel of elvish craftsmanship and necromantic power. This towering structure, reaching skyward with its elegant spires and intricate carvings, serves as the seat of power for the Undying Empire and the locus of the Necromantic Council.

Constructed from the same pristine white bricks adorned with ethereal green veins that characterize the city's architecture, the Spire stands as a testament to the empire's mastery of both beauty and death. Its facade is adorned with delicate filigree and elven runes, weaving intricate patterns that seem to dance with an otherworldly energy.

At the tower's apex, a series of pointed peaks spiral towards the heavens, crowned by a central spire that reaches towards the stars like a beckoning finger. Here, within the highest chamber, lies the throne room of the emperor, where the ruler of the Undying Empire holds court and dispenses decrees with an air of timeless authority.

Within the depths of the Spire, beneath its elegant façade, lies the heart of necromantic power in the empire. Here, the Necromantic Council convenes in chambers shrouded in shadow and mystery. Carved from the living rock beneath the city's foundations, these halls echo with the whispers of ancient incantations and the murmurs of the undead.

The council chamber itself is a vast hall, its walls adorned with tapestries depicting scenes of conquest and domination. At its center sits a circular table of obsidian, etched with arcane sigils and surrounded by high-backed chairs of ebony and bone. Here, the most powerful necromancers of the empire gather to discuss matters of state and to consult with the emperor on matters both mundane and arcane.

Surrounding the Spire, a series of lesser spires and towers rise like sentinels, housing the chambers and laboratories of the empire's most skilled practitioners of the dark arts. Together, these structures form the beating heart of Logrinnstadt, a city where beauty and death walk hand in hand, and where the power of the Undying Empire is felt throughout the realm.
