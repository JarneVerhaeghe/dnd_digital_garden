# Velkagras
## Flavor text
In the heart of the Undying Empire lies a city shrouded in eternal darkness and veiled in an ominous shroud of mystery—the Great Necropolis City of Velkagras. In this haunting metropolis, life's pulse has long since faded, replaced by the relentless march of the undead and the eerie echoes of a bygone era. Velkagras is a place where the living dare not tread, for it belongs solely to the realm of the deceased.

Upon first approach, one is greeted by towering obsidian spires that claw at the lifeless sky, their jagged forms like the skeletal remains of some ancient, monstrous beast. These grim edifices, adorned with intricate carvings of forgotten necromantic spells and symbols, loom ominously over the city, casting long shadows that never wane. It is as though the very architecture itself serves as a grim testament to the unholy power that reigns here.

The streets of Velkagras are paved not with cobblestones, but with the bones of the departed. Gravestones rise like monolithic sentinels, marking the boundaries of this eerie realm. Each tombstone is adorned with flickering ethereal flames that illuminate the darkened paths, casting an eerie, greenish glow on the desolate streets. The sound of ghostly whispers and mournful dirges drifts through the air, carried by the eternal winds that gust through the city's twisted alleys.

In the city's center, a sprawling necropolis, a titanic mausoleum stands sentinel. This colossal structure, known as the "Ebon Citadel," is a monument to the power of necromancy, a testament to the Undying Empire's dark supremacy. Its blackened walls are adorned with intricate latticework, resembling the delicate weave of spiderwebs spun by the damned. At its peak, a colossal, skeletal hand reaches out, clutching a shimmering orb of ominous energy—a symbol of death's eternal grasp over Velkagras.

Within the citadel's shadowy depths, necromancers and lich lords hold court, their presence an ever-present reminder of the city's macabre nature. They convene in grand chambers filled with the echoes of ancient incantations, surrounded by shelves lined with tomes bound in human flesh and illuminated by the flickering light of ghostly candles.

Despite its eerie and sinister ambiance, Velkagras is a vibrant city in its own way. Here, the undead go about their unholy routines, a silent dance of eternal servitude. Skeletal merchants ply their wares in shadowy bazaars, offering enchanted trinkets and necromantic relics of unspeakable power to any who dare trade with them. Spectral performers stage hauntingly beautiful, otherworldly performances in amphitheaters bathed in eerie twilight, where the audience consists of phantoms and wraiths.

In the dark heart of Velkagras, the old palace of the old country stands as the epicenter of this ghastly realm. A towering structure of obsidian and bone, its darkened halls are a labyrinthine maze of secrets, guarded by the most formidable undead sentinels. Here, the Emperor, a lich of unimaginable age and power, rules with a bony hand, presiding over his undead subjects and orchestrating the dark machinations of the Undying Empire.

Velkagras, the Great Necropolis City, is a place where the living dare not tread, a realm where the line between life and death blurs into a never-ending twilight. It is a city of darkness and despair, where the necropolis aspect and its vibrant, eerie existence coalesce to form a haunting, unforgettable tapestry of the macabre.

## Info
**City Structure:**
Velkagras is divided into three distinct zones: the Outer Necropolis, the Inner Necropolis,  Elite necropolis, and the Ebon Citadel.

1. **Outer Necropolis:** This is the outermost ring of the city where newcomers arrive, surrounded by towering black spires. Here, you'll find eerie markets, bone-paved streets, and skeletal guards. The streets are filled with stalls selling enchanted trinkets and necromantic relics. 
2. **Inner Necropolis:** Deeper within the city, the Inner Necropolis houses more permanent residents and is where the undead reside. Spectral performers stage their eerie shows in amphitheaters, and spectral merchants offer more potent and mysterious items. 
3. **Elite necropolis**: all elite, special workers, the elite of the working people
5. **Ebon Citadel:** At the heart of Velkagras lies the imposing Ebon Citadel, home to the old palace and the city's ruling elite. It's a hub of dark magic and political intrigue.


**Shops and Establishments:**
- **The Bone Bazaar:** A bustling market in the Outer Necropolis where skeletal merchants sell eerie trinkets, necromantic scrolls, and dark artifacts.

- **The Shade Theater:** An amphitheater in the Inner Necropolis where hauntingly beautiful performances are staged by spectral actors, attracting both the living and the undead.
- **The Cryptic Arcana:** A hidden library within the Ebon Citadel, housing forbidden tomes and ancient scrolls. Access is restricted to those with political influence or dark knowledge.

**City Mechanics:**

- Eerie Illumination: The streets are dimly lit by spectral flames, providing just enough light to navigate, but darkness lurks in every corner.
